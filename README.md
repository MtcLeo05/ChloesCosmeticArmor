## Commands

The mod in its current state uses commands to set and remove cosmetics, below is a guide for the commands, but they also have their own section in hytale's built-in /help

`/cca-set-item <slot>` sets the current main hand item in a certain cosmetic slot. Available slots are: `head - chest - hands - legs`. If the item cannot be normally put in a certain slot, it won't fit, so you can't wear an helmet as pants!|

`/cca-clear-item <slot>` clears a certain slot, and restores original armor rendering, same slots available

`/cca-vanish-item <slot>` toggles a slot vanish. If a slot is vanished, it will never render armor, cosmetic nor functional
